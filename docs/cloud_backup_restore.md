# Cloud Backup and Restore Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design for cloud backup and restore functionality in Xpenso, allowing Pro users to securely store and retrieve their expense data.

## Feature Requirements
- Automatic cloud backup of expense data
- Manual backup triggering
- Restore data from cloud backups
- Backup history management
- Pro feature (not available in free version)

## Implementation Strategy

### Backup Data Structure
- Complete expense data export
- Budget configurations
- Category definitions (including custom categories)
- User preferences and settings
- Backup metadata (timestamp, device info, version)

### Storage Location
- Firebase Cloud Storage
- User-specific backup folders
- Encrypted storage (optional future enhancement)
- Versioned backups with timestamps

## UI Implementation

### Backup Settings
- Toggle for automatic backups
- Backup frequency selector (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Manual backup button
- Backup history list
- Storage usage indicator

### Restore Interface
- List of available backups
- Backup details (date, size, contents)
- Restore button with confirmation
- Progress indicator during restore
- Success/error feedback

### Backup Management
- View backup history
- Delete old backups
- Download backups to device
- Backup naming (optional)

## Service Layer Design

### BackupService
The BackupService will handle cloud backup and restore operations:

```dart
class BackupService {
  static final BackupService _instance = BackupService._();
  static BackupService get instance => _instance;
  
  BackupService._();
  
  final FirebaseFirestore _firestore = FirebaseFirestore.instance;
  final FirebaseStorage _storage = FirebaseStorage.instance;
  
  // Create backup
  Future<String> createBackup(String userId) async {
    // Export user data to JSON
    // Upload to Cloud Storage
    // Save backup metadata to Firestore
    // Return backup ID
  }
  
  // Restore from backup
  Future<void> restoreFromBackup(String userId, String backupId) async {
    // Download backup from Cloud Storage
    // Parse backup data
    // Restore to local database and Firestore
    // Handle conflicts and duplicates
  }
  
  // Get backup history
  Stream<List<Backup>> getBackupHistory(String userId) async* {
    // Query backup metadata from Firestore
    // Order by timestamp
  }
  
  // Delete backup
  Future<void> deleteBackup(String userId, String backupId) async {
    // Delete backup file from Cloud Storage
    // Delete backup metadata from Firestore
  }
  
  // Schedule automatic backup
  Future<void> scheduleAutomaticBackup(String userId, BackupFrequency frequency) async {
    // Set up backup schedule
    // Configure background processing
  }
}
```

### Backup Model
```dart
class Backup {
  final String id;
  final String userId;
  final String fileName;
  final String storagePath;
  final int fileSize;
  final DateTime timestamp;
  final String deviceInfo;
  final String appVersion;
  final bool isAutomatic;
}
```

## Firebase Integration

### Cloud Storage Structure
```
/backups/
  /{userId}/
    /{backupId}.json
    /{backupId}_metadata.json
```

### Firestore Backup Metadata
```json
{
  "id": "backup123",
  "userId": "user123",
  "fileName": "xpenso_backup_20230115.json",
  "storagePath": "/backups/user123/backup123.json",
  "fileSize": 102400,
  "timestamp": "2023-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "deviceInfo": "Android 12, Pixel 4",
  "appVersion": "1.0.0",
  "isAutomatic": true
}
```

## Data Export Format

### JSON Structure
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "exportDate": "2023-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "userData": {
    "expenses": [...],
    "budgets": [...],
    "categories": [...],
    "settings": {...}
  }
}
```

## User Experience

### Backup Process
1. User enables automatic backups in settings
2. Select backup frequency
3. Backups run automatically in background
4. User can also trigger manual backups
5. Backup history is maintained for 30 days

### Restore Process
1. User navigates to restore section
2. Selects backup from history list
3. Confirms restore action
4. Data is restored to device and Firestore
5. User receives success confirmation

### Progress Indicators
- Backup progress percentage
- Estimated time remaining
- Restore progress percentage
- Data validation during restore

## Error Handling

### Backup Errors
- Network connectivity issues
- Storage quota exceeded
- Firestore save failures
- Data export errors

### Restore Errors
- Invalid backup files
- Data conflicts
- Insufficient storage space
- Permission denied

### User Feedback
- Clear error messages for different failure types
- Success confirmation for completed backups
- Progress updates during backup/restore
- Storage quota warnings

## Privacy and Security

### Data Protection
- User data isolated in Cloud Storage
- No cross-user data access
- Secure transmission of backup data
- Proper access controls

### Encryption (Future Enhancement)
- Encrypt backup files before upload
- Secure key management
- Decryption during restore
- End-to-end encryption option

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test data export to JSON format
- Validate backup upload to Cloud Storage
- Test restore data parsing
- Verify backup metadata operations

### Integration Tests
- Test complete backup creation flow
- Verify restore functionality
- Test automatic backup scheduling
- Validate error handling

### Performance Tests
- Test backup creation time
- Verify restore performance
- Check storage usage efficiency
- Validate backup history management

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Consistency
- Ensure backup includes all user data
- Handle data changes during backup process
- Prevent duplicate entries during restore
- Manage version compatibility

### Storage Management
- Compress backup files to save space
- Automatically delete old backups
- Monitor storage usage per user
- Handle storage quota limits

### Pro Feature Limitations
- Only available to Pro subscribers
- Clear upgrade prompts for free users
- Limited backup history for free users (if any)
- Full features only for Pro users

## Future Enhancements
- Selective backup (expenses only, budgets only, etc.)
- Backup scheduling at specific times
- Cross-platform backup synchronization
- Backup file encryption
- Incremental backups
- Backup to external cloud services (Google Drive, Dropbox)
