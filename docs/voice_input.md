# Voice Input for Expenses Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design for voice input functionality in the Xpenso app, allowing users to add expenses using speech-to-text.

## Feature Requirements
- Speech-to-text conversion for expense details
- Support for multiple languages
- Voice input button on Add Expense screen
- Real-time transcription display
- Error handling for speech recognition failures
- Privacy-conscious implementation

## Implementation Strategy

### Flutter Plugin Integration
Use the `speech_to_text` plugin for speech recognition:

Key classes to use:
- `SpeechToText`: Main interface for speech recognition
- `SpeechRecognitionResult`: Result of speech recognition
- `LocaleName`: Supported locales for speech recognition

### Voice Input Flow
1. User taps voice input button
2. Request microphone permissions
3. Start listening for speech
4. Display real-time transcription
5. Process transcription into expense fields
6. Fill form fields with extracted data
7. Allow user to review and edit before saving

## Speech Processing

### Natural Language Processing
Extract key information from transcribed text:
- Expense amount (numeric values)
- Category keywords
- Description/context
- Date references (today, yesterday, etc.)

### Example Processing
Input: "I spent $25 on groceries today for food"
Processing:
- Amount: $25
- Category: Groceries/Food
- Date: Today
- Description: "groceries for food"

### Text Parsing Algorithm
```dart
class VoiceInputProcessor {
  // Extract amount from text
  double? extractAmount(String text) {
    // Regex pattern to find currency values
  }
  
  // Extract category from text
  String? extractCategory(String text, List<Category> categories) {
    // Match keywords in text to category names
  }
  
  // Extract description from text
  String extractDescription(String text, double? amount, String? category) {
    // Remove identified amount and category from text
  }
  
  // Extract date from text
  DateTime? extractDate(String text) {
    // Parse relative dates (today, yesterday, last week)
  }
}
```

## UI Implementation

### Voice Input Button
- Microphone icon button on Add Expense screen
- Positioned near the description field
- Visual feedback when listening

### Transcription Display
- Real-time text display during speech recognition
- Clear indication when listening is active
- Option to retry if transcription is unclear

### Processing Status
- Loading indicator while processing speech
- Success/error feedback after processing
- Highlight fields that were auto-filled

## Supported Languages
- English (default)
- Spanish
- French
- German
- Italian
- Portuguese
- Russian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Chinese

## Error Handling

### Speech Recognition Errors
- No speech detected
- Audio quality issues
- Network connectivity problems
- Permission denied

### Processing Errors
- Unable to extract amount
- Unable to match category
- Ambiguous information

### User Feedback
- Clear error messages for different failure types
- Suggestions for better voice input phrasing
- Option to manually enter information

## Privacy Considerations

### Data Handling
- Speech data is not stored permanently
- Transcription happens on-device when possible
- Follow platform-specific privacy guidelines

### Permissions
- Request microphone permission at runtime
- Explain why permission is needed
- Handle permission denial gracefully

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test voice input processing algorithms
- Validate amount extraction from different formats
- Test category matching with various keywords

### Integration Tests
- Test complete voice input flow
- Verify form field population
- Test error handling scenarios

### User Experience Tests
- Test transcription accuracy
- Verify processing speed
- Test with different accents and speech patterns

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance
- Minimize processing delay
- Handle long speech inputs efficiently
- Cache supported locales

### User Experience
- Clear visual indicators for listening state
- Helpful examples of effective voice commands
- Option to edit auto-filled fields

### Platform Differences
- Android: Google Speech Recognition
- iOS: Apple Speech Recognition
- Handle platform-specific limitations

## Future Enhancements
- Continuous speech recognition
- Custom voice commands
- Integration with smart assistants
- Voice-controlled navigation
